# Joomla/Virtuemart 2.0 Skroutz Generator V.1.0.1 BETA
==================
Virtuemart XML generator for Skroutz.gr. A flexible, very light and easy to follow script that you can use to generate the XML file Skroutz.gr needs from e-stores. This scripts was tested with Joomla 2.5.8 and Virtuemart 2.0.18a. Feel free to contribute in anyway.


## What can you do with it?
==================
- A very fast grab of all the products. 5.000 products generate 5-6 queries. This solution is by far the most light solution available.
- Config file to set all the info you need.
- You can limit the results for testing
- There is a caching mechanism. You can set the time that your website regenerates/updates the xml file.

==================

I am planning to do in the future:

 - Make the urls tag SEO friendly
 - Protect file from not authorized access
 - Support for more than one level of Depth in Category tag



## SETUP
==================
1. Upload it to your website.
2. Open "setup.php" file and change the values according your website
3. Navigate to generate.php to get the xml structure and give this file path to Skroutz.

Thats it. No kidding!

-- It may take a while if you have a slow server and many products.
