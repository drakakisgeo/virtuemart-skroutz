# virtuemart-skroutz V. 0.1 BETA
==================

Virtuemart XML creator for Skroutz.gr.
Feel free to suggest things. There is a lot of room for improvements here

I am planning to

 - Use a Cache mechanism
 - Make the urls SEO friendly
 - Faster queries / Low resources
 - Refactor the code for greater usability

## SETUP
- Upload it to your website.
- Open "setup.php" file and change the values according your website
- Navigate to generate.php to get the xml structure.

-- It may take a while if you have a slow server and many products.
